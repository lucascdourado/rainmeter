# Rainmeter Skin Configuration: "Ram Display"
This configuration is for a Rainmeter skin named "Ram Display". The skin is designed to display the current physical memory (RAM) usage on the user's desktop.

## Configuration Details
The configuration outlines several components of the skin, including:

- **_BackgroundImage:_** Sets a background image with a solid color (black, with minimal opacity), measuring 75 pixels in height and 65 pixels in width.
  
- **_MeasureRam:_** A meter that monitors the system's physical memory (RAM) usage.

- **_TextStyle:_** A style applied to text, using the "VCR OSD Mono" font with white color and antialiasing enabled for font smoothing. The text is centered.

- **_MeterUsed:_** Displays the text "RAM Usage:" in uppercase, with specified style, font, color, and size, aligned to the right.

- **_MeterUsedPercent:_** Shows the percentage of RAM usage, derived from MeasureRam, with similar formatting and style to MeterUsed, but aligned to the left.

In essence, the skin is designed to offer a clear and stylized visualization of rea
ime RAM usage, with a retro display aesthetic, thanks to the use of the "VCR OSD Mono" font.
